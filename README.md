# redux_store

Fro this application I refactored the code to use Redux. The user is able to create an account, log in with an existing one adn shop on the page. They can add items to their shopping cart and purchase things when they proceed to checkout.

The link deploys but is not showing the items on the screen. It does show locally however.
